Assignment Overview
You are required to design, develop, and deploy a location-based services (LBS) application that demonstrates your understanding of spatial data management, web development, and optionally, a cloud deployment principles. This assignment verifies your ability to integrate multiple technologies into a functional, secure, and accessible web application.

Learning Outcomes Assessed
By completing this assignment, you will demonstrate your ability to:

Design and implement spatial databases using PostgreSQL/PostGIS
Develop web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture
Create responsive, cross-platform user interfaces
Integrate mapping services and spatial visualization
Deploy applications to cloud infrastructure (optional)
Apply security best practices in web application deployment
 

Technical Requirements
Mandatory Technologies
1. Database Layer
Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
Management: CLI or PgAdmin4
Requirements:
Store and manipulate spatial data (points, lines, polygons)
Implement at least 3 spatial queries (e.g., proximity search, containment, intersection)
Properly indexed spatial columns
2. Middle Tier
Framework: Django (Python)
Architecture: Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
Requirements:
RESTful API endpoints for spatial data operations
Data validation and error handling
User authentication (if applicable to your application)
3. Front-End
Interface: Responsive web application
Framework Options: Bootstrap 5 (recommended), jQuery Mobile, Ionic, or similar
Requirements:
Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
Intuitive user interface
Accessible design (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is encouraged)
4. Mapping Component
Library: Leaflet JS
Tile Provider: OpenStreetMap
Requirements:
Interactive map with user controls (zoom, pan)
Display spatial data with appropriate markers/polygons
Custom map interactions (click events, popups, etc.)
5. Deployment
Environment: For this assignment, local deployment is sufficient
Requirements:
All components (Django, database and API access) should be fully functional in a local deployment (your PC or laptop).
Bonus Challenge (+5 bonus marks, max total 30%)
Local Docker Deployment:
Create isolated network (custom subnet)
Separate Docker images for: Django, PostGIS, PgAdmin4, Nginx
Implement reverse proxy with Nginx
Environment-based configuration management
Production-ready security configurations
 

Application Requirements
Functional Requirements
Your LBS application must:

Store Spatial Data: Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on spatial entities
Spatial Queries: Implement meaningful location-based functionality (e.g., “find nearest,” “within radius,” “points of interest”)
Interactive Map: Display spatial data on an interactive map with user interaction capabilities
Responsive Design: Function properly across different screen sizes and devices
Data Persistence: Maintain data integrity across application restarts
Application Ideas (Examples Only - Be Creative!)
Campus navigation system with points of interest
Local business finder with proximity search
Public transport route visualizer
Environmental monitoring stations map
Community event locator
Hiking trail planner
Historical landmarks explorer
Real estate property mapper
Note: Your application should be original. While you may draw inspiration from existing services, direct cloning of classmates’ projects is not permitted.
